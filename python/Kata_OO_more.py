"""
1. Add a square_list class variable to a class called Square so that every time you create a new Square object,
 the new object gets added to the list. 
2. Change the Square class so that when you print a Square object, 
a message prints telling you the len of each of the four sides of the shape. 
For example, if you create a square with Square( 29) and print it, Python should print 29 by 29 by 29 by 29. 
3. Write a function that takes two objects as parameters and returns True if they are the same object, 
and False if not.
